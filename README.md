# Simple-Linear-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent
This project implements a simple linear regression model using the gradient descent algorithm. The goal is to analyze the relationship between two variables (x and y), compute slope and intercept, and evaluate model performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²). The dataset myData.csv contains 100 data points.
